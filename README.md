✅ Automated processing via Google Earth Engine
✅ Scalable solution for smallholders to large agri-businesses
✅ Demo report attached: 📑 Crop Health Report

📊 Use Cases

👩‍🌾 Farmers – Monitor crop growth & detect stress early

🏢 Agri-businesses – Optimize inputs and reduce losses

🤝 Co-operatives – Support members with data-driven insights
